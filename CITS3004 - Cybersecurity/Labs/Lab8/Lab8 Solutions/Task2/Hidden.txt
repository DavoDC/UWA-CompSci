I can turn invisible. It’s a superpower, or at least a secret power. But it’s not like in the movies, and I’m not a superhero, so don’t start thinking that. Heroesare the stars who save the day. I just—disappear.See, I didn’t know, at first, that I had this magic. I just knew thatteachers forgot my name, and kids didn’t ask me to play, and one time,at the end of fourth grade, a boy in my class frowned at me and said, Where did you come from? I don’t think I’ve ever seen you before.I used to hate being invisible. But now I understand: it’s becauseI’m magic.My older sister, Sam, says it’s not a real supersecret power—it’sjust called being shy. But Sam can be rude.And the truth is, my power can come in handy. Like when Momand Sam fight. Like right now.I wrap myself in invisibility and rest my forehead against the backseatwindow, watching raindrops slide down the side of our old stationwagon.“You should stop the car,” Sam says to Mom.Except Sam actually says this to her phone, because she doesn’tlook up. She’s sitting in the passenger seat with her feet slammedagainst the glove compartment, knees smashed into her chest, herwhole body curled around her glowing screen.Mom sighs. “Oh, please, we don’t need to stop. It’s just a littlerain.” But she ticks the windshield wipers up a notch and taps thebrakes until we’re going slug-slow.The rain started as soon as we entered Washington State, and it only gets worse as our car inches past the hand-painted WELCOME TO SUNBEAM! sign.Welcome to Halmoni’s town, a town of nonstop rain, its name likean inside joke.Sam smacks her black-painted lips. “K.”That’s all. Just one letter.She tap-taps her screen, sending bubbles of words and emojis toall her friends back home.I wonder what she’s saying in those messages. Sometimes, when I let myself, I imagine she’s writing to me.“Sam, can you at least try to have a good attitude about this?”
