Memories are life's special moments
Borrowed from the passing of time.
Ghosts and shadows from bygone days,
Etched and stored inside our mind.

Our minds are a memory album
Where the past and present meet,
Memories we lovingly cling to
That make the heart skip a beat.

Some we would like to forget.
Some we love to treasure.
Some memories become precious gifts
That live on forever and ever.

Yes, memories are precious moments,
And I have quite a few,
The memories I treasure the most
Are those I made with you.
