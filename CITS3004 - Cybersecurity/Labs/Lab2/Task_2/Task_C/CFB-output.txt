Some feelings are shallow, some feelings are deeK∞
Some make us ’yM≥mbπyä¥û’ÕD us weep.

Some we love, some we don't.
Some we'll savor, some we won't.

Some grounding, some uplifting,
Some long-lasting, some constantly shifting.

No matter what feelings I'm feeling today,
I know tomorrow is only a day away.
